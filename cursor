The following method works for me !

In the following method, I use the cursor theme OpenZone_Black as an example.

    Extract you downloaded theme to ï½ž/.icons or /usr/share/icons/ (I choose /usr/share/icons/ in the example)

    sudo tar -xv -f ~/Downloads/OpenZone/OpenZone_Black-1.2.3.tar.xz -C /usr/share/icons/

    Copy the cursor.theme file under the system cursor theme folder(like DMZ-White) to your downloaded theme folder.

      sudo cp -a /usr/share/icons/DMZ-White/cursor.theme /usr/share/icons/OpenZone_Black/

        open your copied cursor.theme, and change the line to

        [Icon Theme] Inherits=OpenZone_Black

        Execute the following command in the same terminal at a time:

            record your downloaded theme

                 CURSOR=OpenZone_Black

            add to alternative x-cursor-theme:

                 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme x-cursor-theme /usr/share/icons/$CURSOR/cursor.theme 20

            change the cursor theme

                sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme  

            now select the cursor theme.
